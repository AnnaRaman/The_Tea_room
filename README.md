The Tearoom is an e-commerce website where you can browse and buy teas. The goal of the site is to sell teas to new and existing customers and allow them to filter their search to find the type of product they would like. The site's admin allows the admin to easily view, add, edit and delete products and orders from the database.

### Design

- The purpose of the design of the website was to allow for easy navigation between pages, and have clear and concise detail about each product to encourage informed and easy decision-making in the user. 
- The chosen colour scheme is neutral, with pastel tones for an inviting feel and to link to the idea of many herbal providing a sense of calm. 
- compressed images using tinypng

### Wireframes
- Upon establishment of the user stories, wireframes were drawn as a reference point for the development of the site. They provide a skeleton for the site's structure and specific layout.
- The site is fully responsive so the idea of how it would appear on both desktop and mobile have been included.
